This is the code created for my bachelor's thesis, "Comparison of Linkages for Hierarchical Clustering of Directed, Unweighted Graph Networks." It was created with the assistance of two of my friends.

This repository investigates the four linkages used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering to cluster synthetic and real-world datasets. These datasets are smaller, directed graph networks. Included in this repository are functions for synthetic graph generation, graph clustering using the Agglomerative Clustering function, and graph visualization. There is also a comparison of the accuracy of each linkage for a few given partitions. 

This repository incorporates the clustering functionality in Scikit-Learn.
